# dashboard-mobile-charts

## Purpose
Specifies the capability to render performance comparison charts and distribution metrics for mobile form factors (laptops/notebooks and handheld gaming PCs) on the benchmark dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Mobile Device Detection Logic
The system SHALL scan and analyze the benchmark dataset to identify rows representing mobile devices. Each mobile record MUST be classified as either "Handheld" or "Notebook" based on CPU, GPU, OS, and Kernel signatures.
- "Handheld" signature includes: CPU/GPU containing "Steam Deck", "Z1 Extreme", "Z1", "Custom APU 0405", or "AMD Custom GPU 0405"; or OS/Kernel containing "Bazzite (ROG Ally", "Steam Deck", "Ally", or "Legion Go".
- "Notebook" signature includes: GPU containing "Laptop", "Mobile", or "Geforce MX"; CPU containing Intel mobile suffixes like `H`, `HX`, `HK`, `U` or AMD mobile suffixes like `H`, `HS`, `HX`, `U`, or Ryzen AI processors (excluding those already classified as Handhelds).

#### Scenario: Categorizing a row as Handheld or Notebook
- **WHEN** the benchmark data is processed
- **THEN** rows matching Handheld criteria are labeled as "Handheld", rows matching Notebook criteria are labeled as "Notebook", and all other rows are ignored for the mobile section charts

### Requirement: Mobile Device Type Distribution Chart
The system SHALL aggregate the counts of Handheld vs. Notebook devices and render a doughnut chart displaying their percentage distribution in the dataset.

#### Scenario: Rendering the Mobile Device Type Distribution chart
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** a doughnut chart is rendered showing the percentage of Handhelds versus Notebooks among all identified mobile devices

### Requirement: Top 10 Mobile CPU Performance Chart
The system SHALL identify mobile CPUs in the dataset and render a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 mobile CPU models sorted by average CPU Single score in descending order.

#### Scenario: Rendering the Top 10 Mobile CPU Performance chart
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** a horizontal bar chart is rendered displaying the top 10 mobile CPU models and their average CPU Single scores

### Requirement: Top 10 Mobile GPU Performance Chart
The system SHALL identify mobile GPUs in the dataset and render a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 mobile GPU models sorted by average GPU score in descending order.

#### Scenario: Rendering the Top 10 Mobile GPU Performance chart
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** a horizontal bar chart is rendered displaying the top 10 mobile GPU models and their average GPU scores

### Requirement: Top 10 Handheld Performance Chart
The system SHALL identify handheld gaming PC models in the dataset and render a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 highest individual Main Scores recorded by Handheld devices.

#### Scenario: Rendering the Top 10 Handheld Performance chart
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** a horizontal bar chart is rendered displaying the top 10 highest handheld runs sorted by Main Score in descending order

### Requirement: Notebook vs Handheld Averages Chart
The system SHALL calculate the overall average benchmark scores (Main Score, CPU Single, CPU Multi, and GPU Score) for Notebooks and Handhelds, and render a grouped bar chart comparing these averages.

#### Scenario: Rendering the Notebook vs Handheld Averages comparison chart
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** a grouped bar chart is rendered showing comparison bars for average Main Score, average CPU Single, average CPU Multi, and average GPU Score between the Handheld and Notebook categories
