# software-comparison

## Purpose
Specifies the capability to compare software versions (OS, Mesa driver, NVIDIA driver, Kernel) by head-to-head wins across hardware groups and display the winner for each category.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Software Winner Comparison Computation
The system SHALL group benchmark runs by hardware (CPU for kernel/OS, GPU for drivers) and software version, compute the average score per version per hardware group, and count wins: for each hardware group with 2+ software versions, the version with the highest average score gets a win. The winner is the version with the most wins across all compared hardware groups.

#### Scenario: Computing the OS winner
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** the system groups runs by CPU+GPU hardware, computes the OS with the most per-hardware wins, and displays it as the winner

#### Scenario: Computing the Mesa driver winner
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** the system groups runs by GPU model, computes average GPU Score per Mesa version, counts wins, and elects the version with the most wins

#### Scenario: Computing the NVIDIA driver winner
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** the system groups runs by GPU model, computes average GPU Score per NVIDIA driver version, counts wins, and elects the version with the most wins

#### Scenario: Computing the Kernel winner
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** the system groups runs by CPU model, computes average CPU Single score per kernel version, counts wins, and elects the version with the most wins

### Requirement: Software Comparison Display
The system SHALL render a "Software Comparison" section with 4 cards. Each card SHALL display a category icon, label, WINNER badge with version name, and statistics showing wins/compared hardware count and improvement over 2nd/3rd place.

#### Scenario: Displaying the Software Comparison cards
- **WHEN** the dashboard page finishes loading the benchmark data
- **THEN** four comparison cards are rendered showing the WINNER and improvement for OS, Mesa driver, NVIDIA driver, and Kernel
